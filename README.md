> What could a samurai possibly do with a rusty polearm?

Naginata is a set of alpine-based container images focused on Cybersecurity (pentesting, reverse-engineering and malware analysis) and meant to be a lightweight companion to existing distributions like [Kali](https://www.kali.org/), [ParrotOS](https://parrotsec.org/), [Athena OS](https://athenaos.org/) or [BlackArch](https://blackarch.org/).
